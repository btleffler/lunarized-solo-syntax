Lunarized-Solo
=========
A fork of the Atom version of the famous [Solarized] themeâ€”with a moonlit aura.

Design Decisions
----------------

I'll admit that I'm no design expert. I really love the Solarized syntax theme just like [@aclissold].

This is a very simple fork of his [Lunarized] syntax theme. He did a wonderful job of darkening Solarized. However, I wanted to keep more of the blue that I believe sets Solarized apart from other syntax themes. This simply adds a darker, less saturated version of `base02` and `base03` to Lunarized.

Installation
------------

### To get the Atom package:

* Bring up Settings via `cmd-,`
* Go to the Themes page
* Search for Lunarized-Solo and install
